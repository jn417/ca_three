ECM1400 CA3: Smart Alarm

This web app reflect my interpretation of the CA3 specification. As such, it
allows users to set and delete alarms that subsequently give them updates on
local and national covid news, local weather and news headlines. As well as
automatically notifying them to of the aforementioned every hour on the hour,
silently.
