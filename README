ECM1400 CA3: Smart Alarm

This web app reflect my interpretation of the CA3 specification. As such, it
allows users to set and delete alarms that subsequently give them updates on
local and national covid news, local weather and news headlines. As well as
automatically notifying them to of the aforementioned every hour on the hour,
silently.

REQUIREMENTS

  Python 3.7 or subsequent versions.
  A web broswer, this was created and tested using Chrome so I would recommend
  that.

  I used the following python modules and packages.

  Packages:
    Flask
    uk_covid19

  Modules:
    PyTTSx3
    sched
    time
    requests
    json
    logging

INSTALLATION

  To install the above packages and modules you will need to type the following
  into your command line.

  pip install Flask
  pip install PyTTSx3
  pip install requests
  pip install uk_covid19

TESTING

  Functionality was tested using unit tests and the pytest framework.

CONFIG FILE

  The config.json file contains information such as the api keys and third party
  services used. Also the location of the local weather news. These can be
  edited.

LOGGING

  The sys.log file contains a record of all the alarms set and deleted and
  notifications deleted. As well as other information, such as error data.
